# SiteManager
Site Manager is a web based system for management of Sites, Fischer Sections and Legal Sections.
Primary goal is to provide a user friendly solution based on modern technologies what will be easy to maintain, extend and scale.  

Site Manager uses [Smart Admin](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/smartadmin-responsive-webapp-WB0573SK0) and [Handsontable](https://handsontable.com/). Main goal was to allow users to manipulate data in Excel-like fashion.  

It also uses modal for special forms and views which don't naturally fit into a table view.  

All data is acquired through jquery ajax calls.

It is coupled with [Propel ORM](http://propelorm.org/) through API and user objects with minimal Authentication through hard-coded Authentication key.  

## Installation
Clone repository with 
* ```git clone https://github.com/FHomes/SiteManager.git SiteManager```
* ```cd SiteManager/```

Copy the information from ```propel.yml.example``` into a file called ```propel.yml```.
Copy the information from ```.env.example``` into a file called ```.env```
Then you can use the command:

* ```vagrant up```  

This will then begin the install of all the information that is needed to make Site Manager work.  
Once the install is finished, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8080.

2. Legal Sections
3. Sites
4. Legal Section Mortgages

Initial migration of data is handled by data integrator

## Changes to database
Run rfa script

## Servers
Site Manager development should be done locally, in a virtual machine.
Staging server is at http://sitemanager-staging.fischermgmt.com
Production server is at http://sitemanager.fischermgmt.com
Both use [letsencypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) service for ssl certificates.

Deployment is manual:
commit/push code
ssh into server
pull code
execute Propel "reverse engineer" procedure. There is a "rfa" shell script on both servers which does the same,
or read the [Docs](http://propelorm.org/documentation/cookbook/working-with-existing-databases.html).
